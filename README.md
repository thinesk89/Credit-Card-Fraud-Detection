# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Using Logistic Regression and classifiers of the dataset to produce an accurate recall, f-1 and precision score
Different Kernels are used to detect whether a transaction is normal or fraud. The goals of this project are:
1.	Understand the distribution of the data provided
2.	create a 50/50 split dataset of Fraud and Non-Fraud transactions
3.	Determine the classifier to be used and finding out which has the highest accuracy
4.	Create a Neural network and compare the efficiency to our best classifier
5.	Understand common mistakes made with an imbalanced dataset.
Imbalanced dataset requires f-1 score, confusion matrix or precision/recall score
